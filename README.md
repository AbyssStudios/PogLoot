# PogLoot Minecraft Datapack
PogLoot makes a speedrunners's day easier by improving loot.
## What is this?
PogLoot is a Minecraft: Java Edition Datapack (and in the future a mod) that improves loot from many different things. Some affected things include Piglin Barters (1.16 only), Blacksmith chests, Golem loot, Enderman drops, and more!
## Installing
1.  Download the data pack by clicking "releases" and make sure you get the right version.
2.  Open  _Minecraft_.
3.  Select the world you want to install the data pack for, click on "Edit", then "Open world folder".
4.  Open the folder named  `datapacks`, and put the data pack into it.
5.  Press F3+T to reload datapacks
## FPPH (Frequent Problems People Have)
### P: There is no datapacks folder, I can't find my Minecraft folder, it only accepts "mcpack" files
S: This is probably because you are using an outdated version of Minecraft that doesn't support datapacks or you are using Bedrock Edition. **Bedrock Edition support will be added in a future release!**
### P: My speedrun got rejected
S: This datapack is only for practicing and can't be used in a real run. If you want to use this in a speedrun.com run, go to [this leaderboard](https://www.speedrun.com/mc_pogloot/full_game).
### P: The loot wasn't OP
S: This happens sometimes. In a bad scenario, you might get the minimum drop possible. This is just how the game works and how it generates the loot tables
### P: Does this work on servers?
S: Yes, it does.
### P: I don't know how to install datapacks
S: Scroll up for singleplayer, and for server, modify step 2 to be: Open your server folder, then open the folder of the world you wish to install the data pack in (default:  `world`). Don't do step 5. Type `/reload` from the console or as an operator if the server was running during the installation.
### P: Can I use this in a YouTube video or Twitch stream?
S: Yeah, that's the whole point! If you're on YouTube just leave a link to the releases page somewhere, no specifics. You can put it at the bottom, you can put it in the video for a literal second. Whatever floats your boat. Credit, however, is appreciated. (https://GitHub.com/AbyssStudios/PogLoot/releases)
## Future Plans
We are planning to convert to Fabric and Forge, and we also want to expand to Bedrock Edition. If you have any suggested modifications to the loot tables, just open up a pr or an issue!
